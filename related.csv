We conducted a scoping review, applying Arksey and O'Malley's (International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 8(1), 19-32, Arksey and O'Malley 2005) approach, of peer-reviewed journal articles, to examine the barriers to access and utilization of digital technology to support the transition stage needs (in relation to education, daily living, community integration, and employment) of young adults with developmental disabilities. A total of 29 studies were located that met the review's inclusion criteria. Identified barriers included training, affordability, availability, infrastructure, design, lack of fit with needs, access to community activities, literacy, and accommodations. We applied a socio-ecological approach (Bronfenbrenner & Ceci, Psychological Review, 101(4), 568-586, Bronfenbrenner and Ceci 1994) in interpreting our findings. The review highlights the importance of facilitators for promoting digital inclusion of young adults with developmental disabilities.

dce_3	Mudure-Iacob, I.	2019	Astra Salvensis	Digital literacy: From multi-functional skills to overcoming challenges in teaching ESP	Teaching English for Specific Purposes through the lens of digital literacy is perceived as a contemporary educational conundrum, as it deals with various elements of permanent changes. Focused on using technology and gadgets along the teaching-learning process, teachers and learners require solid digital literacy skills to guide them through the blended learning formats. The acquisition of language skills today is no longer a simple matter of learning and producing content in the physical school environment, but rather, it has become an elaborate process of combining multiple skills (digital, literacy, visual, technological) and creating the most appropriate frameworks for customised learning. With the specificity of teaching ESP, the challenges that occur within this educational endeavour are many and complex, spanning from learners' tailored needs to teachers' tech-saviness. It is therefore the purpose of the current paper to analyse some particularities of ESP teaching based on sharing digital skills, by indicating potential flaws and benefits along the way. The practical viewpoint will be rendered in a brief analysis of the most common and prolific digital tools used to provide aid in teaching specific foundational language skills.

From a methodological point of view, it is a quantitative research developed in a descriptive way. A previously validated questionnaire was used of a sample of 50 special education teachers. Both: hearing and language teachers (AL) and therapeutic pedagogy teachers (PT). The teachers work in different schools: special education schools, common schools, either public, private or a Mixture of both. The results show a deficit in in the Digital Competence, although it is not very important. In the same way, we can say that the teachers' training is medium-low although, they have a positive attitude towards (ICTs). (c) 2019 Grupo de Investigacion FORCE. All rights reserved.
dce_6	Gibson, P.F. and Smith, S.	2018	Information and Learning Science	Digital literacies: preparing pupils and students for their information journey in the twenty-first century	Purpose: In a fast-moving world where technology has become intertwined with our daily lives, meaning information is available at our fingertips, information overload (Khabsa and Giles, 2014) is just one of many challenges that this technological overhaul has presented for learners from the primary classroom up to studies within higher education (HE). This paper aims to present skills needed by both pupils and students to navigate their information journey, and discusses how educators can support the acquisition and development of these skills. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on key literature in the fields of education and academia through the process of systematic review and adopting the analogy of a journey to represent lifelong learning, this bipartite paper explores how both primary school pupils and university students are required to access information in their very own information journeys in this "Information Age". Findings: The similarities and differences between child and adult learners are considered. This paper shares practical strategies for promoting the smarter use of information - and a shorter journey - for these "travelers" along the way. This paper essentially aims to raise questions in the minds of educators as they help to prepare their learners to learn. Originality/value: This paper offers an interesting insight for teachers and lecturers as the crossover between two sets of learners, primary-age pupils and students in HE, is considered in terms of how we, as educators, can help to provide more effective and efficient information journeys, and therefore promote successful learning. A five-stage model is presented for the information journey. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.
dce_7	Poveda, S.	2018	International Development Planning Review	A psychosocial analysis of development outcomes: A digital literacy case study in Myanmar	Information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) research shows inconclusive impacts on human development. Some authors argue that impact can only be studied with a clear definition of development. This paper draws on the capabilities approach, critical pedagogy and critical psychosocial well-being to propose a way of defining and operationalising development, to study a digital literacy initiative in Myanmar. Results show that while participants do indeed improve their digital skills, internalised constraints, such as self-censorship and fear of authority, limit teachers' and students' behaviours during the training sessions, impacting how all related to information. The paper argues that ICT4D will benefit from an understanding of development that acknowledges the social and psychological well-being of individuals, and how these affect each other, enhancing or constraining individuals' development. This acknowledgement may also bring some light to why many initiatives have failed to have the expected impacts, in particular in a long-term perspective. (c) 2018 Liverpool University Press.

In K-12 and higher education, the main approach has been to provide students with checklists they can use to assess the credibility of individual websites. However, the checklist approach is outdated. It would be far better to teach young people to follow the lead of professional fact-checkers: When confronted by a new and unfamiliar website, they begin by looking elsewhere on the web, searching for any information that might shed light on who created the site in question and for what purpose.

This analysis is the first step to reflect on the situation of university teachers. We focus on teachers' professional competence in order to revise their teaching competence, which will allow us to examine different models of teaching digital competence at university. This systematic review is useful when presenting our own proposal. After collecting data on all the dimensions described in previous models, we build a new model based on five dimensions (technical, information and communication, educational, self-reflection, and social and ethical) and three fields of application (teaching, research, and management). This new model may be a useful tool for future empirical research while it may promote critical reflection. (c) 2018 Revista de Educacion a Distancia. All Rights Reserved.

However, how the concepts are used and how they are defined remains unclear. This paper presents a systematic review of research where these concepts are used in higher education research. The aim is to establish an understanding of referencing strategy to digital literacy and digital competence over time, disciplines, countries, methods and level of analysis. Three databases were used in the systematic literature review: Web of Science, Scopus and Education Resources Information Centre. We delimited the search to title, abstract and keywords in the databases. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed publications written in English. Initially 107 publications between 1997 and 2017 were found, with 28 addressing digital competence and 79 digital literacy. Our review demonstrates that there is a range of definitions used in higher education research. They vary depending on if the concepts are defined by policy, research or both and whether they focus on technical skills or social practices. This review indicates directions for further research in higher education i) do more research based on critical perspectives to avoid commonsensical use of the concepts, ii) take the development of definitions of these concepts seriously iii) avoid cross-referencing incompatibilities and finally iv) engage in critical investigations regarding the legitimacy of policy over research in the domain of higher education research.

The number of people needing care, nursing, and medical treatment increases - and their expectations of quality of life rise - faster than the available financial assets and workforce. The article aims at defining the influence of digital literacy of patients and digital-based medical services availability on perspectives of fulfilling health-related needs specific for ageing societies. A variety of information and communication technologies (ICT) solutions can deliver at least temporary relief to countries suffering from these problems, assuming that the potential beneficiaries are able and willing to use such methods. It is thus worthwhile to foster digital literacy, especially among middle-aged and older people. ICT-based solutions include a variety of more or less technologically advanced, sophisticated, and easy-to-use services, many of which have been in operation and common use for decades, and are thus ripe for medical application. Such technologies can create a highly complex system of interconnected electronic tools and information systems operating on sensitive medical data that must remain confidential. These systems aim to increase patients' medical safety and maximize their quality of life, but they also pose serious threats to their privacy. Confidential data are protected by legal regulations, including the recently introduced European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), but primary care physicians should not be discouraged by this from implementing ICT-based solutions into their practices, as they may significantly lessen their everyday workload.

There are named crisis phenomena that inhibit the development of educational system, including professional pedagogical education. The experience of "State University of Humanities and Technology" (GGTU) (Orekhovo-Zuevo) on creation of a modern educational cluster with involvement of infrastructural, organizational, managerial, informative, teaching, methodological and personnel resources is considered. The main positions for updating the contents and methodological components of the University education are determined, namely: adjusting curricula and programs; development of the information educational environment with the use of software for students with pecial health needs; creation of innovative infrastructure through the formation of IT-pace, the creation of content zones and multifunctional information centre. The project includes an IT-Park of a teacher, whose strategic purpose is the implementation of innovative educational practices involving students and schoolchildren. Opportunities for updating the technological organization of the educational process and a new format for upgrading the teaching staff are revealed. Real possibilities for comprehension and practical application of the GGTU experience on creation of its innovation infrastructure, built-up dynamic digital education system by means of attracting a wide range of resources are offered. New resource solutions are aimed at forming the digital literay of the future teacher as a priority of the Russian educational policy.

Among other things the aim of the project is to define the role of librarians in public libraries in their implementation of library services, directed towards supporting learning, primarily in developing digital literacy and information literacy. This engagement requires librarians to have digital competences and various skills needed for carrying out their responsibilities. In order to evaluate the situation realistically, we need to map out the level of librarians' digital literacy. The project created the opportunity for conducting a representative national survey. As a result of this survey, the depth of the digital competence status of librarians working in the Hungarian municipal libraries was assessed. (c) 2018 Infonia. All rights reserved.

This article presents the results of research on teaching practices related to digital competence. From a qualitative approach, a multiple case study was conducted in two schools, identifying facilitators and obstacles in the process of teaching acquisition of digital competence, and delving into the attitudes and use of ICTs according to a school's structure, strategy and culture. The results indicate that the complex process of acquisition of digital competence is the main difficulty of teachers related to the management of information, the didactic use of ICTs, the evaluation of digitally mediated activities and collaboration in virtual environments. The results also point to an image of isolation in professional development, hampering the exchange of experiences and meanings, and the perception of benefit and confidence in the use of ICTs. Teachers demand a training more consistent with their teaching needs. In relation to this, in-school project-based learning work has been recognized as a good practice. It was concluded that there is a need to reduce the gap between the desired digital competence and the actually acquired one by developing autonomous, collaborative, and prolonged training experiences that promote reflective practice and school innovation.

In addition, there are many studies showing that there is a training gap on this subject at the university level. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze future Early Childhood and Primary education graduates' perception regarding digital literacy in order to identify their shortfalls and assess their level of competence in media literacy in conjunction with digital literacy. As reference standards, we used the <<Marco Comun de Competencia Digital Docente>> by the Instituto Nacional de Tecnologias Educativas and the <<Orientacion Normativa y Estrategica de la Alfabetizacion Mediatica e Informacional>> by UNESCO. From that point, an online questionnaire was implemented as an instrument for the development of this study. The results showed that Universidad Internacional de Valencia's education students have an advanced level of competence in the areas of information, communication and audiovisual content creation, which ensures good media, information literacy and digital competences. They showed to have, however, poorer safety and technological innovation skills. Likewise, the future teachers' personal perception about their digital competence is higher than the actual findings of this research show. (c) 2018 Grupo de Investigacion FORCE. All rights reserved.

The authors explore why creative collaboration using digital media texts, tools, and technologies is vital to support the professional development of educators. Creative collaboration experiences generate personally meaningful, transformative learning by promoting personal reflection in a social context. It is important to provide cognitive and emotional support for the risk-taking cycles of experimentation and trial-and-error process that is essential for learning to use digital tools. By using inquiry learning practices through collaborative and creative media production, adult learners thrive by taking on distinct and enmeshed roles that inevitably involve creative tension that stimulates and energizes innovation. (c) 2016 International Literacy Association. Hobbs and Coiro describe a new approach to the professional development of educators, librarians, and media professionals that emphasizes the value of collaborative, interdisciplinary relationships. The authors explore why creative collaboration using digital media texts, tools, and technologies is vital to support the professional development of educators. Creative collaboration experiences generate personally meaningful, transformative learning by promoting personal reflection in a social context. It is important to provide cognitive and emotional support for the risk?taking cycles of experimentation and trial?and?error process that is essential for learning to use digital tools. By using inquiry learning practices through collaborative and creative media production, adult learners thrive by taking on distinct and enmeshed roles that inevitably involve creative tension that stimulates and energizes innovation. Of course, creative partnerships are vital to the work of scholars and teachers with interests in digital and media literacy. Yet, because reading and writing practices are sometimes conceptualized as solo enterprises, we may practice collaboration without giving it the theoretical examination or bandwidth it deserves. Collaboration as both a creative media production practice and an instructional strategy for professional development is still undertheorized and understudied in education. In this commentary, we describe why creative collaboration with digital media texts, tools, and technologies is vital to support the professional development of educators. Because of our shared belief that collaboration through inquiry and media making can generate personally meaningful, transformative learning experiences, we created the Summer Institute in Digital Literacy and the Graduate Certificate in Digital Literacy. We wanted educators, librarians, and media professionals to learn from and with one another, using inquiry practices in the design of transformative learning experiences with digital media and technology. This was important to us in designing the summer institute, and it is also why work with a dyad partner is so important for our approach to professional development in digital and media literacy. During the week, we help participants reflect on their particular styles of collaboration and the habits of mind that best support their own ability to learn with and about digital media. Participants come together to design an instructional unit that addresses a particular learning context, creating at least two forms of multimedia for use in that unit using digital tools that they have learned at the institute. We scaffold instructional design using the digital literacy curriculum framework, which we call the flower model (see Figure <link href=jaal502-fig-0001>). It offers a systematic approach to curriculum development by inviting educators to consider these six elements as they design learning experiences:Context: Start by reflecting deeply on the needs of the learner, considering the context, the community, and your own values and priorities as an educator. Teaching and learning are social practices that are situational and contextual.Purpose: Identify the learning outcomes, standards, or goals of your curriculum.Content: What resources will you use? How will you use print, visual, sound, or digital media texts and tools?Pedagogy: What instructional practices will shape what happens during the learning process?Assessment: What work products will students create? What criteria will be used to assess student learning?Task or activity: What compelling question or scenario will you use to connect your learning tasks to the real world? This component emerges as a creative idea but gets refined and developed by considering the other five elements of the model. As partners inevitably recognize as they work together during the week, the differences between them are a fertile source of creative energy. For example, in 2014, Amanda Murphy, a high school social studies teacher from Rhode Island, collaborated with Kara Clayton, a high school media teacher from suburban Detroit, Michigan. During the summer institute, they developed a project idea: to explore how to best help students use cell phones to support learning. During the 2014-2015 academic year, Amanda and Kara identified the gaps in students' knowledge and skills in the use of cell phones for learning. They discovered that although students use cell phones for social interaction, they are unfamiliar with the many productivity tools that can support their academic work. Then, students identified topics to learn about and worked to create short video tutorials (e.g., how to record a voice memo, set up a calendar notification, scan a document). Finally, students in Michigan and Rhode Island viewed one another's completed videos and offered feedback on them for potential revision. The teachers were pleased that their collaboration helped students extend the authentic audience for their tutorial videos beyond the walls of their school. One thing is certain: Although we both want to support teachers in advancing these practices in K-12 and higher education, we do not want these ideas to get oversimplified into a silly checklist, as sometimes happens in education. Given how fast technology and media are changing, what instructional strategies best prepare people for an unknowable future? Second, dyads provide cognitive and emotional support for the process of learning to use digital tools. Most participants identified themselves as beginning? or intermediate? level users of digital media and technology. Some arrive with fears and anxieties that their skills are not adequate. During the week, participants have many opportunities for low? stakes exploration of digital tools. They have many opportunities to experience success. Quantitative and qualitative evidence from the program evaluation has helped us learn that participants appreciated the mix of theory and time for hands? on exploration; they valued the opportunity to choose which digital skills to develop and to have time for using, exploring, and creating (Hobbs, Coiro, Friesem, Viens, & Jaffee, <link href=jaal502-bib-0003>). Having a partner nearby and being able to rely on other people to help with problem solving when experiencing challenges can be helpful in dealing with the frustration that can occur when learning to use new digital tools. Third, dyads support the cycles of risk taking, experimentation, creative iteration, and rapid prototyping, which are key parts of the creative design process. Ideas grow out of shared conversation (Riverdale Country School & IDEO, <link href=jaal502-bib-0006>). We give teachers enough time to get to know each other while learning new digital tools and new pedagogical approaches. We model and scaffold a variety of versatile instructional strategies during the day. Having a dyad partner to share ideas with and explain what has been learned creates repeated opportunities for practice. We surround them with people who have expertise using digital tools, texts, and technologies. Most importantly, participants see us engaged in problem solving when things do not go as planned. Because we demonstrate the ability to work through the inevitable challenges and snafus that occur when using digital media and technology for learning, we think this helps build teacher confidence.

Thanks to specific educational interventions and appropriate evaluation tools for self-assessment, future educators should be helped to acquire the appropriate media skills necessary to develop the capacity to responsibly and autonomously choose proper media to design their media education courses. The media competence enhances teachers' ability to creatively modify learning spaces and to design a variety of stimulating activities in order to promote their pupils' independent and aware work.

The results, consistent with earlier studies, confirm that the participating preservice teachers inaccurately self-assessed their digital competence. The study concluded that subjective self-assessment lacks appropriate validity and is not an accurate stand-alone predictor of digital competence among preservice teachers. However, if considered in conjunction with other means, self-assessment may prove to be useful for preservice teachers to aid in their reflection of their competence, skills, and knowledge and to aid them in adjusting their perceptions and attitudes regarding technology throughout their professional practice. In addition, self-assessment in conjunction with other means may assist teacher educators in providing opportunities to improve the competence in teacher training programs. (c) 2016 The Author(s).

dce_24	Instefjord, E.	2014	Nordic Journal of Digital Literacy	Appropriation of digital competence in teacher education	The aim of the article is to explore opportunities for appropriation of digital competence in teacher education. Digital competence is knowledge, skills and attitudes required in order to use technology critically and reflectively in the process of building new knowledge. According to Wertsch learning to use a cultural artefact is characterized by two processes: mastery and appropriation. The article reports from a case study of two teacher education institutions. Findings indicate that the same challenges are found in both institutions: the conflict between mastery and appropriation, and between personal and educational use of technology, and the resistance towards technology among some teacher educators. The results signify that in order to create opportunities for appropriation of digital competence and encourage use of technology as part of pre-service teachers' professional didactic competence, technology should be better integrated as pedagogical tools for teaching and learning in all subjects in the teacher education programmes.

The purpose of the review is to showcase and establish knowledge about empirical research on ICT-training in teacher education, and contribute with an overview of approaches for researchers, teacher educators, and policymakers on how teacher education develop student teachers' digital competence for the secondary school grade level. A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Based on a thematic analysis of the studies, including coding and categorization strategies, eight approaches were identified: collaboration, metacognition, blending, modeling, authentic learning, student-active learning, assessment, and bridging theory/practice gap. The approaches consider ways that teacher education programs promote student teachers' digital competence, and educate them in professionally using ICT for their future use in school and classroom teaching in secondary education.

The focus of this position paper is on the conceptualization of professional digital competence (PDC) in the teaching profession and its consequences for teacher education. The aim is to establish a concept that captures, challenges, and possibilities related to teaching and learning in technology-rich settings. By using three school subjects as cases, we argue the necessity of viewing PDC as comprising a deep understanding of technology, knowledge of students' learning processes, and an understanding of the specific disciplinary practices and features characterizing individual school subjects.

A large number of papers on this topic have been published. The most relevant reviews point out that by and large the use of social networks by the net generation does not mean that young people has natural digital skills/competencies they apply in the learning activities. The present brief review discusses the relevant literature considering the various definitions of "digital literacies". In particular an JISC study "Thriving in the 21st century. Learning Literacies for the Digital Age" (LLiDA Project) is cited, because of its approach to a very detailed definition of learning literacies. Moreover, in spite of them making use of the most recently available sources like Wikipedia recent papers have shown that the search and reading approach of the net generation - lacks selection criteria and quality.

Studies show that computer use, computer skills, and computer-related self-concepts are subject to gender differences. These differences may affect classroom interactions as well as learning processes and have therefore to be considered carefully by teachers who apply computer supported learning. This article presents a quantitative study to illustrate particular fields affected from gender differences. Furthermore, a qualitative study reveals students' perceptions of gender differences. The article presents four dimensions that may help teachers to analyze origins of emerging gender inequalities and closes with suggestions for facilitation methods.

The project goal was to identify how this new generation learns and uses Digital Technologies of Information and Communication (TDIC) in and out of school. It also sought to analyze how the domain of such technologies affects such generation's performance in school. The digital literacy is understood here as a set of skills to read, write and interact with other people, mediated by digital technology devices, whose acquisition by Generation Y occurs at home, still in infancy. A questionnaire about socio-economic and technological development was applied, and the participants (children and adolescents aged 9 to 14) were filmed when performing learning activities in the school computer lab in order to observe what were their technological skills. The results indicated that exposure to early technological equipment makes the acquisition of digital literacy by Generation Y as natural as learning to walk and talk and bring in positive impacts on its school learning.

Findings are based on a study that examined users' digital literacy through both observations and survey questions, making it possible to check the validity of survey proxy measures. These analyses yield a set of recommendations for what measures work well as survey proxies of people's observed web-use skills. Some of these survey measures were administered on the General Social Survey 2000 and 2002 Internet modules, making the findings relevant for the use of existing large-scale national data sets. Results suggest that some composite variables of survey knowledge items are better predictors of people's actual digital literacy based on performance tests than are measures of users' self-perceived abilities, a proxy traditionally used in the literature on the topic.

In order to fill its societal functions, it must provide the students with the basic knowledge and skills that they will need in everyday life, at work and as citizens. Thus, when society is in transition from industrialism to post-industrialism, from standardized massproduction to customer-oriented production, from taylorism to learning organizations and from basic literacy to lifelong learning, the school must adapt accordingly. In the coming decades, we will probably experience revolutionary changes on a global scale when the world discover ICT, the Internet and its immense possibilities. Governments and intergovernmental organizations are currently working intensively on plans of action that aim towards a swift and rapid transition. That brings important issues on the agenda: Who is to decide the necessary changes? Will the changes be beneficiary for the society as a whole? Most politicians belong to a generation with limited knowledge of the possibilities that the digital technologies can offer. That is also valid for those who educate the next generation. In other words, there is a risk that the changes of society might be more complicated than expected. In the world of commerce, the process of adaptation started in the 1980's. Taylorism and behaviorism is abandoned and metacognition, the learning process, the production of knowledge and the learning of organizations have been put into focus. A lifelong learning at work and a learning leadership is considered essential. The Internet and ICT is also being integrated into this process. At school, there has been more moderate changes of goals and methods. Basic knowledge of reading, writing and arithmetic is still considered as sufficient literacy, and training of predefined facts and non-reflected skills is the main method. When ICT is being used at school, it is generally used in a way that strengthens the usual goals and methods. There is undoubtedly a need for a new concept of literacy that gives a meaning and a structure of relevance to the usage of ICT and the changes of society. This new concept of literacy - digital literacy - is centered around learning and the social, communicative and reflective process of learning. It recognizes many different ways to knowledge, not only reading and writing, and does also include non-cognitive factors such as affective and social skills. If the school is to fill its function in society, it must change its way of working. This is of utmost importance for a fair and positive evolution of the post-industrial society.
dce_107	Pettersson, Fanny	2018	Education and Information Technologies	On the Issues of Digital Competence in Educational Contexts--A Review of Literature	In this review focus is on how digital competence in educational contexts has been addressed in international research over the last 10 years in terms of policy, organizational infrastructures, strategic leadership as well as teachers and their teaching practices. The analysis shows that although research on digital competence in educational contexts has increased, knowledge on digital competence related to organizational infrastructures and strategic leadership are sparse. The analysis indicated that most research focuses on the specific competence needed by teachers and therefore tends to neglect the influence of broader contextual conditions in the wider school setting. Based on the review, three suggestions for further research can be provided. Firstly, to address research on organizational infrastructures and digital competent leadership. Secondly, to elaborate on theoretical frameworks that can close the gap between research on policy, organizational infrastructures, strategic leadership as well as teachers and their teaching practices. A third suggestion is for researchers to become involved in the development of new approaches that can enhance digital competence in educational contexts. It can be concluded that digital competence might not benefit from being regarded as an isolated phenomena on the level of single actors. Rather, it can be regarded as an organizational task, influenced and driven by several contextual factors embedded within and across a wider school organization.
dce_108	Ilomaki, Liisa and Paavola, Sami and Lakkala, Minna and Kantosalo, Anna	2016	Education and Information Technologies	Digital Competence--An Emergent Boundary Concept for Policy and Educational Research	Digital competence is an evolving concept related to the development of digital technology and the political aims and expectations of citizenship in a knowledge society. It is regarded as a core competence in policy papers; in educational research it is not yet a standardized concept. We suggest that it is a useful boundary concept, which can be used in various contexts. For this study, we analysed 76 educational research articles in which digital competence, described by different terms, was investigated. As a result, we found that digital competence consists of a variety of skills and competences, and its scope is wide, as is its background: from media studies and computer science to library and literacy studies. In the article review, we found a total of 34 terms that had used to describe the digital technology related skills and competences; the most often used terms were digital literacy, new literacies, multiliteracy and media literacy, each with somewhat different focus. We suggest that digital competence is defined as consisting of (1) technical competence, (2) the ability to use digital technologies in a meaningful way for working, studying and in everyday life, (3) the ability to evaluate digital technologies critically, and (4) motivation to participate and commit in the digital culture.
dce_109	Palacios Hidalgo, Francisco Javier and Gomez Parra, M.a Elena and Huertas Abril, Cristina A.	2020	Teaching English with Technology	Digital and Media Competences: Key Competences for EFL Teachers	The usefulness of ICT in language learning is unquestionable nowadays. There are many digital educational resources available for foreign and second language teachers, materials which are progressively acquiring an important role in the teaching-learning process. In order to respond to the increasing presence of such technologies in the classroom, teachers need to acquire digital and media competences, two key elements for lifelong training process. However, these are superficially addressed in teacher education. In this light, both in-training and in-service educators demand more skills and specific training to be able to teach students how to use technologies and, ultimately, help them develop their own digital and media competences. Following an exhaustive bibliographical revision of scientific literature in the field, this theoretical paper seeks to revise the concepts of digital and media competences as well as to reflect on how superficially they are addressed at universities and teacher-training centres. After this, the importance of both competences as key elements for teachers is brought to light, as well as some useful suggestions to help foreign and second language teachers acquire and develop them and, simultaneously, teach them to their students.
dce_110	Brown, Susan A.	2014	International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education	Conceptualizing Digital Literacies and Digital Ethics for Sustainability Education	Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the need for integrating a focus on digital literacies and digital ethics into sustainability education, proposing a conceptualization of these for sustainability education. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on relevant literature in the field of sustainability education and in the field of digital literacies and digital ethics. It synthesizes perspectives in both fields to form a conceptualization of digital literacies and digital ethics for sustainability education. Findings: The paper conceptualizes "digital literacies" as a capacity to reflect on the nature of digital space in relation to sustainability challenges and "digital ethics" as a capacity to reflexively engage with digital space in ways which build rich discourses around sustainability. Critically reflective and exploratory activities in digital space are a means of developing these capacities. Originality/value: The conceptualization allows sustainability education to account for the increased role digital space plays in shaping views of sustainability challenges. It proposes a pedagogical approach to doing this.
dce_111	Hall, Marion and Nix, Ingrid and Baker, Kirsty	2013	Electronic Journal of e-Learning	Student Experiences and Perceptions of Digital Literacy Skills Development: Engaging Learners by Design?	In the current digital environment, it is vital for learners to develop digital literacy skills. The UK's Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (HE) requires graduates to demonstrate digital literacy. Employers consider these skills essential. With the high cost of HE in the UK, learners themselves also expect university courses to demonstrate relevance to the workplace. Nevertheless, some learners may not fully engage in digital literacy skills development, instead concentrating on the subject-specific content of their modules. The Faculty of Health & Social Care (FH&SC) at the UK's Open University uses different approaches to digital literacy skills development, based on skills resources that are either "generic" (usable by any FH&SC module) or module-specific. By exploring student experiences of digital literacy skills development, we aim to understand what motivates learners to engage with the skills content of their module. We collected data from online questionnaires and interviews involving learners from three modules and present findings from an analysis of the quantitative questionnaire data, supported by qualitative interview data, where relevant. We look at learner perceptions and engagement in relation to the demographic factors gender, age, previous education, disability and financial status and whether these factors influence individual learner preferences for learning design, such as use of generic resources versus contextualisation of skills activities within the module. We aim to identify good practice in learning design and what demographic factors need to be considered to support individual learners appropriately, and so optimise engagement.

It concludes that institutions need to place greater value on "literacies of the digital", and better prepare their students and their own organizational processes to thrive in an age of digital knowledge practices. It extends the debate about individual entitlement and provision to ask whether digital literacy offers an opportunity for the academy to redefine its relationship to knowledge in society.
dce_113	Blummer, Barbara	2008	Education Libraries	Digital Literacy Practices among Youth Populations: A Review of the Literature	Digital literacy includes a range of abilities from basic computing skills to the creation of multimodal texts. This literature review examines eleven articles that track the digital literacy practices of youth populations or individuals between the ages of 12 and 17. It describes the practices of these individuals through three perspectives, including: studies centered on general youth populations, research discussing innovative programs targeting students from low income families, and articles tracking digital literacy competencies among young immigrant learners. Foremost, the articles highlight young people's efforts to express themselves through their own online literacy. To this end it remains essential that educators correlate students' digital literacy habits in their personal lives to instructional practices in school.
dce_114	Beach, Richard	2012	Research in the Schools	Uses of Digital Tools and Literacies in the English Language Arts Classroom	This article reviews research on English language arts teachers' use of digital tools in the classroom to remediate print literacies. Specifically, this review focuses on the affordances of digital tools to foster uses of digital literacies of informational/accessibility, collaboration knowledge construction, multimodal communication, gaming literacy, and reflection on learning. Researchers have found relatively high levels of students' engagement through their uses of digital tools for the social purposes of accessing, sharing, communicating, and reflecting on knowledge as part of a shared learning commons. Students are also engaged in multimodal representations of knowledge for immediate and worldwide audiences, as well as participation in collaborative gaming activities for both acquiring knowledge and learning collaboration practices. Researchers have also found that teachers and students employ uses of digital feedback tools and e-portfolios for effectively fostering student reflection. The findings from the research reviewed suggest the need for teachers to identify the affordances of digital tools in ways that remediate and transform largely print-based learning in English language arts classrooms through uses of digital tools.
